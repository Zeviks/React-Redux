1.  We always first create a react app  
    https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html

OPTIONAL:  NPX
            directly installs all of the pacjkages required, 
            and runs them immidiatley. and then deltes them from the disk.

PACKAGE.json
        This is what tells other developers what libraries/dependencies are installed to rrun this project.


STRICTMODE:
            This will protect you against depricated code.
            It will limit you in certain areas to prevent deprecated code from running.
            It will trow warnings about does specific things in case you use them.

BUILD:
        By running the build command, react will condence all files into
        one very optimal low memory super optimized file. 
        And this will allow us to send that file faster through the web.

TEST: 
    This is for testing an specific file and to ensure the file does what it is suppose to do.

EJECT: 
    BABEL: Takes JSX and turns it into ES5 aka vanilla JS or Old School JS.

WEBPACK: 
    It breaks our javascript into chunks, self-contained version
    And it request does chuncks accordingly.

COMPONENT: 
    A component is a self-sustained fucntion that returns html 
    AKA the thing we see and interact with.

KEY: 
    When we are creating elements in react we want to give each element its own unique key.
    Becuase react will keep track on that specific key. 
    Meaning that in the future if you need to change only a specific element
    React can do so by updating the element with the unique id.
    Also it would not have to re-render the whole page again.
    This is mainly used for components of the same kind, to prevent confusion.

LIFECYCLE COMPONENTS:
    Thse are components that execute automatically by react at a certain point.
    For example, componentDidMount executes when the corresponding componentent
    is fully loaded.

FETCH API:
    We use the built in fetch() to fetch data from apis.
    Then we turn that data into json which we can then feed into our
    state/app.

React Component Architecture: 
            Built in components will usally be all lowercased,
            in comparison wiht our created componets which are Capitalized
            There's two ways of creating components

            Functions 
            1. export const CardList(prop) {
                return (
                    <h1>This is a component</h1>
                )
            }

            Classes
            2. class App extends Component {
                constructor(){
                    super();
                    this.state
                }
                render() {
                    return{
                        <h1>This is a component</h1>
                    }
                }
            }
            export default App;

JSX Extension:
        We can use the .jsx file extension to organized our files even more.

Props / Properties: 
        This are values that are passed as attributes when the component is called.
        For Example 
        <CardList name='Natha'/>
        Name in this case is a variable that would be passed to the main function from where its called.
        Which means we can attach values from the current file its being called in and pass a value to the main file 
        where the function lives at.

Children: This is something that if theres none an we called it, we will get by default null.
          Children is what we pass in between the component
          For Example
          <CardList>
                 Children
          </CardList>

ON CHANGE: Whenever we encounter an even in react, it is not an html event. It's a React Synthethic Event.
A synthethic event is a fake event that intercepts the original event, and then the "react bot" tries to 
figure out where to apply the change to himself.
Is the reason why its camel-cased.
Whenever out onchange is called. It pretty much triggers a function oncall.

YOU CAN'T CREATE A SETSTATE INSIDE OF A RENDER FUNCTIONS.
WHEN REACT RUNS THE RENDER FUNCTION AND ENCOUNTERS THE SETSTATE IT WILL RE-RENDER.
AND THEN ONCE IT SEES THE RENDER FUNCTION IT WILL DO IT AGAIN.
RESULTING IN A NEVERENDING LOOP. THIS IS WHY WE DEFINE FUNCTIONS FOR EVENTS.

In this case anytime react encounters this event it will trigger the function in it.
SINCE WE DONT INTERACT WITH THE DOM, THE BOT DOES. IT WILL DECIDE WHEN TO DISPLAY THE CONTENT.

OUR UPDATED CONTENT WONT  BE VISIBLE IMMIDEITALY. SINCE THE REACT BOT BATCHES AND QUEUES WORK
AND IT WILL DECIDE WHEN ITS THE MOST OPTIMIZED TIME TO DISPLAY IT.



FUNCTIONAL COMPONENTS:
                Functional components do not have access to state because they dont have access to constructor since thats a class method
                They also dont have access to lifecycle methods or internal state since we dont always have to use them.

                There's times all we want to do is render html. This is the main purpose of functional components.

                For individual components we use functional component
                
                When making the entire structure of the page like in what order to display the components 
                We Use Class Components

                Class Components = Smart Components
                Functional Components = Dumb Components 

            In the end, a functional components is just a function that gets some PROPS
            and displays html.

            If you dont need access to state us this.

=======
Breaking Things Down: 
        Breaking things down into small chuncks its the best approach to component Architecture
        We should create a component with a single purpose.
State vs Props 
       State: Usually lives at the top, or at one spot. State can change but props cannot.
       State gets turn into props as it gows down the data flows so it can be used whereever its needed.

WHEN STATE CHANGES:
        When state changes it will alert any props that state has change to rerun the function to recive the new props.
        What vever functions needs the props froms state will rerender when stae has changed.
        Meaning anything that contains props from stae will re-render.
ASYNC STATE:
        Whenever we are chaging state its maing a async function meaning that the changes aren't aveliable immidiatly.
        In order for us to have access to the data immiidiatly we would have to pass the function a second argument.
        For Exmaple                                  --Second Argument--
        { this.setState({name: props.name}, () => console.log(this.state.name) }
        
        Whatever we want to do with our recived data we would do it in the second argument function.
        Since its called right after the first argument
WHERE TO PUT STATE:
        We always want to place state in a place where it can be access from anywhere
        in the app. 
        We always want to place the sstate towards the top or moving up the state 
        This is known as lifting the state.
        
this : 
        Is a special keyword that referenses the context 

LEXICAL SCOPING:
        When we make our own custom functions they're automatically assing to the
