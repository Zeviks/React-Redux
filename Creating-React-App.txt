1.  We always first create a react app  
    https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html

OPTIONAL:  NPX
            directly installs all of the pacjkages required, 
            and runs them immidiatley. and then deltes them from the disk.

PACKAGE.json
        This is what tells other developers what libraries/dependencies are installed to rrun this project.


STRICTMODE:
            This will protect you against depricated code.
            It will limit you in certain areas to prevent deprecated code from running.
            It will trow warnings about does specific things in case you use them.

BUILD:
        By running the build command, react will condence all files into
        one very optimal low memory super optimized file. 
        And this will allow us to send that file faster through the web.

TEST: 
    This is for testing an specific file and to ensure the file does what it is suppose to do.

EJECT: 
    BABEL: Takes JSX and turns it into ES5 aka vanilla JS or Old School JS.

WEBPACK: 
    It breaks our javascript into chunks, self-contained version
    And it request does chuncks accordingly.

COMPONENT: 
    A component is a self-sustained fucntion that returns html 
    AKA the thing we see and interact with.
