What makes React so special is 4 Things 

Imperative : This is where certain things change/ update or trigger on user event(click)
Don't touch the DOM. I'll do it for you.
For example when the site is loaded fetch the user's profile and display their profile image.


Declaratives: 
This is where we declare our app in an object to the dom. 
And the 'bot' will find the best way to display our app. 
State is the data of our app.
Based on the data/state you provide react in this way. This is where the name comes from.
