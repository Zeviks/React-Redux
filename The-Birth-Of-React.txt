In The beginning, the early late 90s and ealy 2000s websites only used mainly html, css, and js.
But this will become a huge issue as website continue to improve and grow. Since they had to develop based on each individual browser.

This issue got resolved with jQuery. jQuery allowed us for the the first time to interact with the dom with ease throught all of the browsers.
But eventually with this power developers started building more and more bigger scale sites. Like Facebook, a site with tons of functinality.

Then Backbone.js came out. Backbone allowd developers to organize their js files. Making jQuery easy to work with.

Then came SPA, Single Page Applications. This applications only load the Html, Css, and JS once.
Similar to Desktop Applications. 
We started to focus more on the js file than the html file.

Then In 2010, Angular.js was made. 
This framework introduce a new way to organaized and create files/features.
In containers, making sections or features inside of their own component. 
But this too became tough to work with as when the site would grow to a larger scale so would the maintance.
And confusion would also grow heavily since users where clinking in multiple sections of the site to take them to the same spot.
Becoming difficult for developers to keep track of this.

So Facebook began researshing how to solve this issue.

Then in 2013 React was launched.
Since at a similar time gooogle was redoing their own codebase with angular, most people switch to react.
